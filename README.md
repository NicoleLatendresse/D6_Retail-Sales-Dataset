-------------------
Tech Setup:

Create .venv 
    requirement.txt file from visualiation module [Mary]
    copy it into D6_RETAIL... folder

code:
uv venv --python 3.11
uv pip install -r requirements.txt 



if we see underline under a library comment, it would tell us what packages we are missing. we can then use following command:
    use uv pip install <package name>

we'll put .venv inside gitignore file

EVERYONE: after clone/fetch from Main you can get the updated file (requierement.text and gitignore) that Mary pushed up 02-25
